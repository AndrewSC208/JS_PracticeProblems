	<h1>why am I typing all of this out?</h1>
	<p>My passion is to teach young people how to achieve the goals that they want to. I want young people to change the decisions they make to improve themselves. I think that while I am writing this book I need to keep in mind that not all people what to change all the time. I need to keep in mind that they people that do want t change might not be as extreme as me. But that is now who I am writing this book to or do I intend for them to read it.</p>

	<p>The audience that I want to read this book are people that what to change there lives on larger level. I want to ask question that will make my audience question what they do it and why they do it. I am not sure if the is possible but I think that I can find a way. </p>

	<h3>Welcome to The stretch</h3>

	<h4>Intro</h4>

	<p>Hello, my name is Andrew Meiling! I know right that is now the greatest intro in the world but it works. I am a normal human being just like everyone that is going to read this book. Unless you are from the really distant future and your some genomice prototype. I currently live in San Diego, CA with my Wife Brittany. I am 27 and I have really only put in about six years of professional experiance, but it was at a uniqe time in the world. The stock market just crashed, the housing bubble just exploded, and we as a country were spiraling into the worst recession that we have seen since the great depression. All while I was finishing my undergraduate degree at Evangel University in Marketing, and Management. I might add that having a generic degree in such a can I say volitale market is not the greatest way to market yourself. </p>
