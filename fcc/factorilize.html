	Return the factorial of the provided integer.

	If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

	Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

	For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

	Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.
